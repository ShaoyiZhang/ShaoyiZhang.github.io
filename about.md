Hey there! My name is Shaoyi Zhang (Shawn). I'm a software engineer on the Data Analytics Platform team
at [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/).

I spent 18 years in my hometown [Suzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou) in China before going to college
at [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/). In 2018, I graduated from UCSB with B.S. in
Computer Science and B.S. in Statistical Science. After graduation, I joined
the [Application Express team(APEX)](https://apex.oracle.com/en/), part of Oracle Database Cloud.

Now, I live in Woodinville, Washington. The commute to Seattle downtown is horrible.

Piglet has been with me since 2017. She's a vocal and needy Ragdoll cat.

I'm an indoor person who like plastic models(GUNPLA) and video games. However, recently I'm in love with my Sony A7M4
camera and started to go out more frequently.

The Jekyll theme is from [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
