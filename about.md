Hey there! My name is Shaoyi Zhang (Shawn). I'm a software engineer at Oracle Database Cloud APEX team.

I was born in Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. I lived there for 18 years before going to college at University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2018, I graduated from UCSB with B.S. in Computer Science and B.S. in Statistical Science.

Now, I'm in Reston, Virgina, where the APEX team is based in.

I have a white Ragdoll cat named Lady Pig.

The Jekyll theme is from [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
